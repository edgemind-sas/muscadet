# muscadet

## Introduction

MUSCADET is an open-source knowledge base (KB) framework under the MIT license, written for the PyCATSHOO framework. It aims to facilitate the creation of modeling tools for performing risk and performance assessments of physical systems, particularly those that involve flow propagation (electricity, water, signals, information, etc.). MUSCADET is a French acronym for "ModÃ©lisation de flUx StoChAstiques DiscrETs," which translates to "discrete stochastic flow modeling."

This KB relies on the smart component approach, meaning the ultimate goal is to build system models that resemble the real physical architecture of the underlying target system. More concretely, MUSCADET consists of a set of basic PyCATSHOO objects that can be used to efficiently build PyCATSHOO modeling tools on top of it for representing specific classes of systems. For instance, MUSCADET can be used to create a modeling formalism dedicated to electrical system models where the analyst can directly manipulate busbars, breakers, transformers, etc.

## Prerequisite

- Install the PyCATSHOO library by following the instructions on the official website: [http://www.pycatshoo.org/](http://www.pycatshoo.org/).

  To verify the successful installation of PyCATSHOO, open a Python terminal and execute the following command:

  ```python
  import pycatshoo
  ```

  If no errors are raised, the installation is successful.

- Next, install the MUSCADET library in your environment from GitHub:

  ```sh
  pip install https://github.com/edgemind-sas/muscadet.git
  ```
  
## Getting started

We propose creating a basic Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) toolkit using the MUSCADET framework. An RBD consists of three types of components:

- **Sources:** Components capable of producing a functional flow
- **Blocks:** Components that can receive and propagate flows
- **Targets:** Components that receive the flows

Each component can have random failures and repair events governed by an exponential distribution, parameterized by failure and repair rates.

First, import the `muscadet` library:

```python
import muscadet
```

### Creating the components

Now, create the `Source` component like this:

```python
class Source(muscadet.ObjFlow):

    def add_flows(self, **kwargs):

        super().add_flows(**kwargs)

        self.add_flow_out(
            name="is_ok",
			var_prod_default=True,
        )
```

Key points to note are:

- When using the MUSCADET framework, you need to make all components inherit from `muscadet.ObjFlow`.
- You need to override the `add_flows` method (hence the `super().add_flows(**kwargs)` call) to declare all inputs and outputs.
- In this case, the source has only one output, producing a flow named `"is_ok"`. The idea is to make the source produce the `"is_ok"` flow while no failure occurs in the source. To model this, we use the `add_flow_out` method with the parameter `name` set to `"is_ok"` and `var_prod_default` set to `True`, indicating a source is producing flow by default.
- Currently, no failure information is provided, meaning the source is perfect and never fails.

To go a bit deeper into the MUSCADET framework, please note that in the background, the `add_flow_out` method adds the following elements to the components (as shown in the figure below):
- A connection output port named `is_ok_out` to allow the source to be connected to other components.
- A boolean attribute `is_ok_prod` indicating if the component is producing the `is_ok` flow.
- A boolean attribute `is_ok_prod_available` indicating if the component can produce the `is_ok` flow.
- A boolean attribute `is_ok_fed_out` indicating if the component is fed with the `is_ok` flow.
- A boolean attribute `is_ok_fed_available_out` indicating if the component can propagate the `is_ok` flow out.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph Source
        direction LR;

        subgraph Variables
        direction TB;
            A[is_ok_prod]
            B[is_ok_prod_available]
            C[is_ok_fed_out]
            D[is_ok_fed_available_out]
        end

    end

    C ---> Export[is_ok_out]
```

At this point, it is worth providing an initial explanation of the flow propagation logic for an output flow named `f`:

- If the component is available to produce flow `f` (i.e., `f_prod_available` is `True`), then the production may be enabled depending on whether `f_prod` is `True` or `False`. If `f_prod_available` is `False` (for instance, because a failure event occurred), then `f_prod` is forced to `False`.
- If the component produces the flow `f`, then it can be propagated to output if the output function is available, controlled by the boolean attribute `is_ok_fed_available_out`. Note that we can distinguish two levels of availability: one for production and one for propagation to output.
- If the flow is available to be propagated, the value of `f_fed_out` is propagated to connected components.

The previous process is illustrated in the following diagram:
```mermaid
graph TB;
    A[f_prod_available?]
    B[f_prod?]
    C[f_prod=False]
    D[f_fed_available_out?]
    E[f_fed_out=True]
    F[f_fed_out=False]
	G[or]
	H[and]

    A -- Yes --> B
	A -- No --> C
	C ---> G
	G ---> F
	B -- No --> G
    B -- Yes --> H
	D -- Yes --> H
	D -- No --> G
	H ---> E
```

Now, let's create the `Block` component:

```python
class Block(muscadet.ObjFlow):

    def add_flows(self, **kwargs):

        super().add_flows(**kwargs)

        self.add_flow_in(
            name="is_ok",
			logic="and",
        )

        self.add_flow_out(
            name="is_ok",
            var_prod_cond=[
                "is_ok",
            ]
        )
```

Key points to note are:

- We use the `add_flow_in` method to add an input flow named `"is_ok"` to be consistent with the `Source` component's output flow.
- The parameter `logic="and"` means we want all connected components to a block to produce the `"is_ok"` flow to consider the block verified for the flow `"is_ok"`.
- As for the output version, the `add_flow_in` method creates additional attributes like `is_ok_in` and `is_ok_available_in` to control the component's ability to let the flow `is_ok` in.
- We also add an output flow named `"is_ok"` using `add_flow_out` to propagate flows named `"is_ok"`.
- The `var_prod_cond` parameter is used to specify a list of input flows that must be verified by the component (here `"is_ok"`) to propagate the flow `"is_ok"` to output.

Finally, let's create the `Target` component :
```python
class Target(muscadet.ObjFlow):

    def add_flows(self, **kwargs):

        super().add_flows(**kwargs)

        self.add_flow_in(
            name="is_ok",
			logic="and",
        )
```
The `Target` component is just like a `Block` component without output.

### First RBD

Now our generic components ready, we are going to model the following RBD :

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'securityLevel': 'loose',
    'theme': 'default',
    'htmlLabels': false
  }
}%%
graph LR;
    S[Source S] -->|is_ok| B1[Block B1];
	S[Source S] -->|is_ok| B2[Block B2];
    B1 -->|is_ok| T[Target T];
	B2 -->|is_ok| T[Target T];
```

It represents a source `S` providing flows to both parallel blocks `B1` and `B2` that finally propagate flows to target `T`.

Here is the code to create this RBD with MUSCADET:
```python
# Step 1: System Initialization
# Initialize a new system named "My first RBD"
my_rbd = muscadet.System(name="My first RBD")

# Step 2: Adding Components
# Add a source component named "S"
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Source", name="S")

# Add a block component named "B1"
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Block", name="B1")

# Add another block component named "B2"
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Block", name="B2")

# Add a target component named "T"
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Target", name="T")

# Step 3: Connecting Components
# Connect the source "S" to block "B1" using the "is_ok" flow
my_rbd.connect("S", "is_ok_out", "B1", "is_ok_in")

# Connect the source "S" to block "B2" using the "is_ok" flow
my_rbd.connect("S", "is_ok_out", "B2", "is_ok_in")

# Connect block "B1" to the target "T" using the "is_ok" flow
my_rbd.connect("B1", "is_ok_out", "T", "is_ok_in")

# Connect block "B2" to the target "T" using the "is_ok" flow
my_rbd.connect("B2", "is_ok_out", "T", "is_ok_in")
```
Detailed explanation:

1. **System Initialization:**
   - We initialize a new system using `muscadet.System` and give it the name "My first RBD".

   ```python
   my_rbd = muscadet.System(name="My first RBD")
   ```

2. **Adding Components:**
   - We add a source component named "S" to the system.
   - We add two block components named "B1" and "B2".
   - We also add a target component named "T".

   ```python
   my_rbd.add_component(cls="Source", name="S")
   my_rbd.add_component(cls="Block", name="B1")
   my_rbd.add_component(cls="Block", name="B2")
   my_rbd.add_component(cls="Target", name="T")
   ```

3. **Connecting Components:**
   - We connect the source "S" to the block "B1" with the flow named "is_ok".
   - We also connect the source "S" to the block "B2" with the same flow "is_ok".
   - Next, we connect the block "B1" to the target "T" to propagate the "is_ok" flow.
   - Similarly, we connect the block "B2" to the target "T" to propagate the "is_ok" flow.

   ```python
   my_rbd.connect("S", "is_ok_out", "B1", "is_ok_in")
   my_rbd.connect("S", "is_ok_out", "B2", "is_ok_in")
   my_rbd.connect("B1", "is_ok_out", "T", "is_ok_in")
   my_rbd.connect("B2", "is_ok_out", "T", "is_ok_in")
   ```

We can now add an indicator on the target component to monitor if it is correctly fed by the `is_ok` flows. Remember that theoretically, this should be the case since no failures are considered for now. To achieve this, we use the `add_indicator_var` method as follows:

```python
my_rbd.add_indicator_var(
    component="T",
    var="is_ok_in",
    stats=["mean"],
)
```

- The `component` argument specifies the component on which we want to create an indicator.
- The `var` argument sets which component variable to monitor.
- The `stats` argument allows us to provide a list of statistics to be measured on the monitored variable.

In this case, we want to monitor `is_ok_fed_in`, which is a boolean indicating if the `is_ok` flow correctly fed the input of target component `T`.

### Simulation

Once our system is built, we can run a simulation to observe flow propagation in the system. Since no random event is considered for now, the system is entirely deterministic. Consequently, running the simulation should always give the same results, that is, flows `is_ok` propagate without trouble from source `S` through both blocks `B1` and `B2` to finally reach target `T`.

The following code run a simulation of the system :
```python
my_rbd.simulate(
    {
        "nb_runs": 1,
        "schedule": [{"start": 0, "end": 24, "nvalues": 23}],
    }
)
```

We can graphically observe the values taken by the variable `is_ok_fed_in` during the simulation with:
```python
fig_indics = my_rbd.indic_px_line()
fig_indics.show()
```
Note that the method `indic_px_line` produces a Plotly graphic that can be displayed with the `show` method.

The code for this example is available [here](examples/rbd_01/rbd_01.py).

### Deterministic Failures

Let's now add deterministic failures for both components `B1` and `B2`. A failure can be considered an event that changes the state of a component. In our case, we suppose that a failure can happen if the component is fed by the flow `is_ok`. When a failure occurs, the component becomes unable to propagate the flow `is_ok` downstream, meaning `is_ok_fed_available_out` becomes `False`, and consequently, `is_ok_fed_out` also becomes `False`. In this first example, we consider deterministic failures that trigger after fixed delays (4 time units for `B1` and 8 time units for `B2`). Once the failure is present, a repair event occurs deterministically after 2 time units for `B1` and 3 time units for `B2`.

The classic way to represent this kind of behavior is to use a 2-state automaton to transition from the absence of failure to the presence of failure. To do that in MUSCADET, we can use the `add_atm2states` method like this:
```python
my_rbd.comp["B1"].add_atm2states(
    name="failure_deterministic",
    occ_law_12={"cls": "delay", "time": 4},
    cond_occ_12="is_ok_fed_out",
    effects_12=[("is_ok_fed_available_out", False)],
    occ_law_21={"cls": "delay", "time": 2},
)
```
The parameters of this method are:
- `name`: The name of the automaton.
- `cond_occ_12`: The condition to enable a transition from the first state to the second state.
- `occ_law_12`: The occurrence law for the transition from the first state to the second state. Here, we have a deterministic delay of 4 time units.
- `effects_12`: The effects of the transition from the first state to the second state.
- `occ_law_21`: The occurrence law for the transition from the second state to the first state. Here, we have a deterministic delay of 2 time units.

For `B2`, we use an equivalent approach that utilizes the high-level method `add_delay_failure_mode` to simplify the automaton creation:
```python
my_rbd.comp["B2"].add_delay_failure_mode(
    name="failure_deterministic",
	failure_cond="is_ok_fed_out",
	failure_time=8,
	failure_effects=[("is_ok_fed_available_out", False)],
	repair_time=3,
)
```
As we see here, failure/repair behavior is specified more directly.

It is now time to evaluate the RBD by launching a simulation. But before that, let's first add indicators to monitor the `is_ok` flow output status for components `S`, `B1`, and `B2`:
```python
my_rbd.add_indicator_var(
    component=".",
    var="is_ok_fed_out",
    stats=["mean"],
)
```
Note that the `component="."` parameter means that we want to create an indicator to monitor the `is_ok_fed_out` variable of each component. If a component has no `is_ok_fed_out` variable, no indicator is created.

We can launch a simulation and show results as previously:
```python
my_rbd.simulate(
    {
        "nb_runs": 1,
        "schedule": [{"start": 0, "end": 24, "nvalues": 1000}],
    }
)

fig_indics = my_rbd.indic_px_line(
    markers=False, title="Flow monitoring in the RBD", facet_row="name"
).show()
```

![Results](./examples/rbd_02/indics.png)


We observe that target `T` is correctly fed if we have flow propagation from both `B1` and `B2` simultaneously.

The code for this example is available [here](examples/rbd_02/rbd_02.py).

### Stochastic Failures

Stochastic failures and their associated variables are similar to deterministic failures, with the key difference being that stochastic failures occur randomly based on failure and repair rates. In this example, we consider stochastic failures for component B3, which can be triggered approximately every 8 time units. Once a failure occurs, a repair event can occur approximately every 4 time units for B3.

A classic way to represent this behavior is to use a 2-state automaton to transition between the absence and presence of a failure. In MUSCADET, this can be achieved using the `add_exp_failure_mode` method as shown below:
```python
my_rbd.comp["B3"].add_exp_failure_mode(
    name="failure_stochastic",
    failure_cond="is_ok_fed_out",
    failure_rate=1/8,
    failure_effects=[("is_ok_fed_available_out", False)],
    repair_rate=1/4,
)
```

The parameters of this method are:
- `name`: The name of the automaton.
- `failure_cond`: The condition to enable a transition from the current state to the sefailure state.
- `failure_rate`: The transition rate from the available state to the failure state. In this case, the transition occurs approximately every 8 time units.
- `failure_effects`: The effects that occur during the transition from the available state to the failure state.
- `repair_rate`: The transition rate from the failure state back to the available state. Here, the repair occurs approximately every 4 time units.

Before lauching a simulation, we add indicators to monitor the `is_ok` flow output status for components `B3`:
```python
my_rbd.add_indicator_var(
    component="B3",
    var="is_ok_fed_out",
    stats=["mean"],
)
```
Note that the `component="."` parameter means that we want to create an indicator to monitor
the `is_ok_fed_out` variable of each component. If a component has no `is_ok_fed_out` variable,
no indicator is created. You can replace "B3" by "." to create the indication for each block.

We can launch a simulation and display the results. For stochastic simulations, it is advisable to use a high number of runs to average out the randomness (e.g., nb_runs = 10 000):
```python
my_rbd.simulate(
    {
        "nb_runs": 10000,
        "schedule": [{"start": 0, "end": 24, "nvalues": 1000}],
    }
)

fig_indics = my_rbd.indic_px_line(
    markers=False, title="Flow monitoring in the RBD", facet_row="name"
).show()
```

![Results](./examples/rbd_03/indics.png)


We observe that target `T` is correctly fed if we have flow propagation from both `B1`, `B2` and `B3` simultaneously.

The code for this example is available [here](examples/rbd_03/rbd_03.py).

### Source Triggered on condition

A source can produce and propagate a flow to the connected target as long
as it is not in failure state. However, a source with an "out_on_trigger" flow will only propagate
its flow if a triggering condition is true.

In this example, there are two sources: the first will propagate its flow by default, while the second source
will only propagate its flow if the main source cannot propagate its flow because of a failure.

```python
# Components classes
# ==================
class Source(muscadet.ObjFlow):
    def add_flows(self, **kwargs):
        super().add_flows(**kwargs)

        self.add_flow_out(
            name=flow1,
            var_prod_default=True,
        )
		
class SourceTrigger(muscadet.ObjFlow):
    def add_flows(self, **kwargs):
        super().add_flows(**kwargs)

        self.add_flow_out_on_trigger(
            name=flow1,
            trigger_time_up=1,
            trigger_time_down=0,
            trigger_logic="and",
            var_prod_default=True,
        )
		
class Target(muscadet.ObjFlow):
    def add_flows(self, **kwargs):
        super().add_flows(**kwargs)

        self.add_flow_in(
            name=flow1,
            logic="or",
        )
```

The specific parameters of the method `add_flow_out_on_trigger` are:
- `trigger_logic`: The logic applied on the condition to trigger the flow. Can be `and` or `or`.
- `trigger_time_up`: The transition time from the waiting state to the run state. In this
  case, the transition occurs after 1 time units.
- `trigger_time_down`: The transition time from the run state to the waiting state. In this case, the transition occurs after 0 time units. 

To activate the second source when the main source is unavailable, they must be connected as below.

```python
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Source", name="S1")
my_rbd.add_component(cls="SourceTrigger", name="S2")

my_rbd.connect_trigger("S1", "S2", flow1)
```

Here the flow to connect is `flow1` with `S1` as the main source and `S2` as the triggered source.

A classic way to represent this behavior is to use a 2-state automaton to transition between the absence and presence of a failure. In MUSCADET, this can be achieved using the `add_delay_failure_mode` method as shown below:
```python
my_rbd.comp["S1"].add_delay_failure_mode(
    name="failure_deterministic",
    failure_cond="is_ok_fed_out",
    failure_time=6,
    failure_effects=[("is_ok_fed_available_out", False)],
    repair_time=6,
)
```

The parameters of this method are:
- `name`: The name of the automaton.
- `flow_name`: The flow to stop if the component is not available.
- `failure_cond`: The condition to enable a transition from the current state to the sefailure state.
- `failure_time`: The transition time from the available state to the failure state. In this
  case, the transition occurs after 6 time units.
- `failure_effects`: The effects that occur during the transition from the available state to the failure state.
- `repair_time`: The transition time from the failure state to the repair state. In this case, the transition occurs after 6 time units.

Now we can launch a simulation and display the results for all the `fed_out` flow. 


![Results](./examples/rbd_04/indics.png)


We observe that target `T` is correctly fed if we have flow propagation from `S1` or `S2`.

The code for this example is available [here](examples/rbd_04/rbd_04.py).


### Knowledge base classes

Some generic classes can be import from the knowledge base "kb".
The generic classes present in kb are:
- Source
- SourceTrigger
- Block
- Target

The **Sources** components are capable of producing a functional flow
The **SourceTrigger** components are capable of producing a functional flow depending on a triggering condition
The **Blocks** components can receive and propagate flows
The **Targets** components that receive the flows

There are 2 methods to create a component of a Class from the knowledge base.

```python
import muscadet.kb.rbd as rbd

# Components classes
# ==================
# Add components
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Source", name="S1")
s1 = rbd.Source("S1")
```
The method "add_component(cls=className, name=componentName)" can find the className in the imported file. (Source is available in muscadet.kb.rbd)
The second method is "rbd.Source(name)", Source is accessible from the rbd.

```python
import muscadet.kb.rbd as rbd

# Components classes
# ==================
# Add components
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Source", name="S1")
my_rbd.add_component(cls="SourceTrigger", name="S2")
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Block", name="B1")
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Block", name="B2")
my_rbd.add_component(cls="Target", name="T")
```
The code for this example is available [here](examples/rbd_05/rbd_05/rbd_05.py).

### Sequences analysis

Pycatshoo can analyze for each simulation the list of transitions that have been triggered and obtain the list of all sequences obtained after all simulations.
To do this, the list of transitions to observe msut be monitored. The transitions to monitor can be filtered to display only the transitions of a specific component, for example.
Here, using the pattern "#.*" allows to monitor all transitions to be exhaustive.

To analyze all the sequences that lead to a particular state of an element, the method "setTarget" must be used. Thus, each simulation will stop as soon as the target is reached.

```python
# Configure sequences
# -------------------
my_rbd.addTarget("top_event", "T.is_ok_fed_in", "VAR", "!=", 1)
my_rbd.monitorTransition("#.*")
```

The parameters of the target method are:
- `name`: The name of the target, "top_event".
- `variable`: the name of the target event, "T.is_ok_fed_in".
- `target type`: The type of the transition to reach. Should be a variable "VAR" or a "STATE"
- `condition`: The condition to stop, var != 1 for example.

```python
# System simulation
# =================
my_rbd.simulate(
    {
        "nb_runs": 10,
        "schedule": [{"start": 0, "end": 24, "nvalues": 1000}],
    }
)
```

To use the Analyser and export the sequences in HTML and XML result files, some methods from Pycatshoo library must be imported.
The method `printFilteredSeq` will create an XML file with all the explored sequences, and then an HTML file will be created if a Java application is installed. 

```python
import Pycatshoo as pyc

analyser = pyc.CAnalyser(my_rbd)
analyser.keepFilteredSeq(True)

analyser.printFilteredSeq(100, "sequences.xml", "PySeq.xsl")
```

The code for this example is available [here](examples/rbd_05/rbd_05_bis/rbd_05_bis.py).
